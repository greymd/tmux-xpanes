```

## Introduction

Try this command line.

```sh
$ xpanes 1 2 3 4
```

You will get the screen like this.

```
$ echo 1                       │$ echo 2
1                              │2
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
-------------------------------+-------------------------------
$ echo 3                       │$ echo 4
3                              │4
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

Oh, you are not familiar with key bindings of tmux?
Don't worry. Just type `exit` and "Enter" key to close the panes.

```
$ exit                         │$ exit
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
-------------------------------+-------------------------------
$ exit                         │$ exit
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

As shown above, input from keyboard is synchronized within multiple panes by default.

### `-c` option and `-I` option.
`-c` option allows to execute original command line.
For example, try this one.

```sh
$ xpanes -c 'seq {}' 1 2 3 4
```

You will get the screen like this.

```
$ seq 1                        │$ seq 2
1                              │1
                               │2
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
-------------------------------+-------------------------------
$ seq 3                        │$ seq 4
1                              │1
2                              │2
3                              │3
                               │4
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

`seq` command which generates sequencial numbers is specified by `-c`.
As you can see, `{}` is replaced each arguments. This placeholder can be changed by `-I` option like this.

```sh
$ xpanes -I@ -c 'seq @' 1 2 3 4
```

`echo {}` is used as the default placeholder when no commands is specified by `-c` option.

[Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html) given by Bash or Zsh is very useful to generate sequential numbers or alphabetical characters.

```sh
# Same as $ xpanes 1 2 3 4
$ xpanes {1..4}
```

## Behavior modes.

Basic usages are shown above. Before showing further usages, it is good to know about the conditional behavior of `xpanes`  command.

### [Normal mode1] Outside of tmux session.

When the tmux is not being opened and `xpanes` command is executed on the normal terminal, the command's behavior is supposed to be that.

The command newly creates a tmux session and new window on the session.
In addition, it separates the window into multiple panes. Finally, the session will be attached.

### [Normal mode2] Inside of tmux session.

When the tmux is already being opened and `xpanes` command is executed on the existing tmux session, the command's behavior is supposed to be that.

The command newly creates a window **on the exisging active session**.
In addition, it separates the window into multiple panes.
Finally, the window will be active window.

### [Pipe mode] Inside of tmux session & Accepting standard input.

When the tmux is already being opened and `xpanes` command is executed on the tmux (which means Normal mode2).
In addition, when the command is accepting standard input ( the command followed by any other commands and pipe `|`), the command's behavior will be special one called "Pipe mode". It will be introduced [Pipe mode section](#pipe-mode).

## Further Examples

#### Ping multiple hosts

```sh
$ xpanes -c "ping {}" 192.168.1.{5..8}
```

The result is like this.

```
$ ping 192.168.1.5             │$ ping 192.168.1.6
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
-------------------------------+-------------------------------
$ ping 192.168.1.7             │$ ping 192.168.1.8
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

This example is the one having [Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html).

#### Monitor multiple files

```sh
$ xpanes -c "tail -f {}" /var/log/apache/{error,access}.log /var/log/application/{error,access}.log
```

The result is like this.

```
$ tail -f /var/log/apache/error.log       │$ tail -f /var/log/apache/access.log
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------
$ tail -f /var/log/application/error.log  │$ tail -f /var/log/application/access.log
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
```

Hmm? you want to monitor those files through the SSH? Just do it like this.

```sh
# 'ssh user@host' is added.
$ xpanes -c "ssh user@host tail -f {}" \
/var/log/apache/{error,access}.log \
/var/log/application/{error,access}.log
```

#### Connecting multiple hosts over SSH with same user

```sh
$ xpanes -c "ssh myuser@{}" host1 host2
```

```
$ ssh myuser@host1             │ $ ssh myuser@host2
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

#### Use SSH with ignoring alert message.

`--ssh` option is helpful to ignore the alert message from OpenSSH. It is not required to answer yes/no question against it. Use it if you are fully sure that destination host is reliable one.

```sh
$ xpanes --ssh myuser1@host1 myuser2@host2
```

This is same as below.

```
$ xpanes -c "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no {}" myuser1@host1 myuser2@host2
```

#### Suppress input synchronization

To disable the synchronization of keyboad input within panes, use `-d` (or `--desync`)  option. The input is applied to only one of them. Set `tmux synchronized-pane` `on` in order to re-enable synchronization.

```
$ xpanes -d -c "ssh {}" myuser1@host1 myuser2@host2
```

#### Connecting multiple hosts over SSH **AND logging operations**.

```sh
$ xpanes --log=~/operation_log -c "ssh {}" user1@host1 user2@host2
```

The result is like this.

```
$ ssh user1@host1              │ $ ssh user2@host2
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

In addition, log files will be created.

```
$ ls ~/operation_log/
user1@host1-1.log.2017-03-15_21-30-07
user2@host2-1.log.2017-03-15_21-30-07
```

File name format for log file can be specified with `--log-format` option. Please refer to `xpanes --help`.

**Attention:** Logging feature does not work properly with specific tmux version. Please refer to [wiki > Known Bugs](https://github.com/greymd/tmux-xpanes/wiki/Known-Bugs) in further details.


#### Execute different commands on the different panes.

`-e` option executes given argument as it is.

```sh
$ xpanes -e "top" "vmstat 1" "watch -n 1 free"
```

Then the result will be like this.

```
$ top                          │$ vmstat 1
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
-------------------------------┴------------------------------
$ watch -n 1 free






```

You will get the same result with this command line.

```sh
$ xpanes -I@ -c "@" "top" "vmstat 1" "watch -n 1 free"
```

#### Changing layout of panes.

To change the layout of panes, put an argument followed by `-l` option.
This is the example that lines up some panes vertically.

For example, to line up panes vertically, put `ev` (it is correspoinding to `even-vertical` in [tmux manual](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html)).

```bash
$ xpanes -l ev -c "{}" "top" "vmstat 1" "watch -n 1 df"
```

It would be like this.

```
top




-------------------------------------------------------------
vmstat 1




-------------------------------------------------------------
watch -n 1 df




```

With same way, `eh` (`even-horizontal`), `mv`(`main-vertical`) and `mh`(`main-horizontal`) are available. Please refer to `xpanes --help` also.

#### Share terminal sessions with others.

 `~/.cache/xpanes/socket` file is automatically created when `xpanes` runs. Importing this socket file, different users can share their screens each other. Off course, you can specify the socket file name as you like with `-S` option.

* user1

```sh
[user1@host] $ xpanes -S /home/user1/mysocket a b c d ...
```

* user2

```sh
[user2@host] $ tmux -S /home/user1/mysocket attach
```

... then, user1 and user2 can share their screen each other.

#### Create multiple windows and make each one divided into multiple panes.

As mentioned above, `xpanes` command creates a new window when it starts to run on the tmux session. Utilizing this behavior, it is possible to create multiple windows easily.

```sh
$ xpanes -c "xpanes -I@ -c 'echo @' {}; exit" \
  "groupA-host1 groupA-host2" \
  "groupB-host1 groupB-host2 groupB-host3" \
  "groupC-host1 groupC-host2"
```

Result will be this.

| window  | pane1              | pane2              | pane3              |
| ------  | -----              | -----              | -----              |
| window1 | `ssh groupA-host1` | `ssh groupA-host2` | none               |
| window2 | `ssh groupB-host1` | `ssh groupB-host2` | `ssh groupB-host3` |
| window3 | `ssh groupC-host1` | `ssh groupC-host2` | none               |

Can you guess why such the phenomenon happenes?
Running this command, such the window is supposed to be created at first.

```
$ xpanes -I@ 'ssh @' groupA-host1 groupA-host2; exit │$ xpanes -I@ 'ssh @' groupB-host1 groupB-host2 groupB-host3; exit
                                                     │
                                                     │
                                                     │

                                                     │
                                                     │

-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
$ xpanes -I@ 'ssh @' groupC-host1 groupC-host2; exit








```

Let's focus on the upper left pane.

```
$ xpanes -I@ 'ssh @' groupA-host1 groupA-host2; exit
```

When this command is executed on the tmux session, **it will create new window** which separated into two panes like below. And as you can see, `; exit` statement will close the pane itself after the separation.

```
$ ssh groupA-host1             │ $ ssh groupA-host2
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
                               │
```

Same phenomenon will be occurred on upper right and bottom panes. The window which had three `xpanes` statements is closed itself. Finally, just the three windows will be left.

## Pipe mode

Pipe mode is activated when `xpanes` command is accepting standard input.
With this mode, `xpanes` behaves like UNIX `xargs`.

```sh
# Pipe mode
$ seq 3 | xpanes
```

With this command line, the output would be like this.

```
$ echo 1                                  │$ echo 2
1                                         │2
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------
$ echo 3
3                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
```

Pipe mode has two features.

1. `xpanes` command's argument will be the common command line which will be used within all panes (this is corresponding to the `-c` option's argument in Normal mode).
1. Single line given by standard input is corresponding to the single pane's command line (this is corresponding to normal argument of `xpanes` in Normal mode).


```bash:tmux_session
# The command line generates some numbers.
$ seq 4
1
2
3
4

# Add those numbers to xpanes command.
$ seq 4 | xpanes seq
```

The result will be like this.

```
$ seq 1                                   │$ seq 2
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------
$ seq 3                                   │$ seq 4
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
```

Off-course, `-c` and `-I` options are available.

```sh
$ seq 4 | xpanes -c 'seq {}'
## xpanes seq
##    and
## xpanes -c 'seq {}'
##    are same.
```

However, giving both `-c` and any arguments causes error. Because the command cannot decide which argument should be used.

```bash:tmux_session
$ echo test | xpanes -c 'echo {}' echo
# Error: Both arguments and '-c' option are given.
```

### Connecting to multiple hosts given by `~/.ssh/config`

For example, let's prepare `~/.ssh/config` file like this.

```text
Host host1
    User user1
    HostName 192.168.0.2
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host host2
    User user2
    HostName 192.168.0.3
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host host3
    User user3
    HostName 192.168.0.4
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Parse host name with general UNIX commands.

```sh
$ cat ~/.ssh/config | awk '$1=="Host"{print $2}'
host1
host2
host3
```

Giving the results to `xpanes ssh` command.

```sh
$ cat ~/.ssh/config | awk '$1=="Host"{print $2}' | xpanes ssh
```

The results would be like this.

```
$ ssh host1                               │$ ssh host2 
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
                                          │
------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------
$ ssh host3
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          
```

Pipe mode allows you to make combinations between tmux and other general UNIX commands like this.
